# Five Nights at Freddy's in Java

## Story

Way back long ago in the world of 2014 in AP Computer Science, we had to make a game to finish off our first semester. I decided to make a Five nights at freddy's clone because the game was popular at the time, and seemed easy to replicate, so here it is.

### About

* Entirely made in Java
* Uses original assets from Five Nights's at Freddy's
* Needs 2GB of RAM (Don't ask me why, I'm afraid to know)

Have fun trying it out if you want, some stuff is still kinda broken, but this was a lot of fun to make, and it might be cool if you want to see how it works.

Thanks for taking a look!
